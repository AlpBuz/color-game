Hello Everyone, This is a simple color game where the player has to enter the correct color they see on the screen. However the only thing is is that the color and word that is displayed are different Example: Word: Red, Color: Blue Correct Answer: Blue

This was developed using React, Python(Flask) and Daisy UI

To try it out yourself just download the files and run 'npm start' to run the frontend locally Then open up a virtual environment for the backend and move the server.py and helpers.py to the virtual environment. Then run "python server.py"

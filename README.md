# Getting Started with ColorGame

Hello Everyone, This is a simple color game where the player has to enter the correct color they see on the screen. 
However the only thing is that the color and word that is displayed are different
Example:
Word: Red, Color: Blue
Correct Answer: Blue

To try it out yourself just download the files and run 'npm start' to run the frontend locally
Then open up a virtual environment for the backend and move the server.py and helpers.py to the virtual environment.
Then run "python server.py"

Makes sure you have the node_modules including DaisyUI and Tailwind installed.
The project was made using ReactJS, Python(Flask), and Tailwind(DaisyUI)

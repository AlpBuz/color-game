# Getting Started with ColorGame

Hello Everyone, I created this project to help learn and improve my skills in reactjs and Python. This is a 
simple color game where the player has to enter the correct color they see on the screen. However the only thing is
is that the color and word that is displayed are different
Example:
Word: Red, Color: Blue
Correct Answer: Blue

To try it out yourself just download the files and run 'npm start' to run the frontend locally
Then run '' to run the python backend locally as well and enjoy the game.
